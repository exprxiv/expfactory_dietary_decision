    "description": "Subjects rate 50 items for health and for tastiness in two stages on a five point scale. The order of ratings as well as order of buttons is counterbalanced across subjects. A reference item for health and tastiness, rated neutrally previously on both scales, is chosen for each subject. In stage 3 they are first presented with this reference item and told to choose between the other food items and the reference item. Participants are grouped ex post as self-controllers or non-self-controllers depending on whether they choose the items in stage 3 ranked higher in taste or in health (self controller if you choose the item ranked higher on health and vice versa for non-self-controller).",
